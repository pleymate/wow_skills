# How to use
You can either run the script with python (I used 3.10), or use the executable in release: https://github.com/Pleymate/wow_skills/releases/tag/v0.0.1

If you run the script with python, you need selenium (version 4.2.0)

> pip3 uninstall selenium

> pip3 install selenium==4.2.0

Find your Chrome client version by doing Help -> About Chrome

Download your Chrome Driver version here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Extract to C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Driver\chromedriver.exe

If you're using the executable and it's is closing instantly, you can see the error by opening a command prompt, cd to the executable folder and execute it just by typing its name
